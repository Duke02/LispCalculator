# Lisp Calculator

A simple, Rust-powered Lisp-style calculator — built for fun (and to help me be a good body double for my fiancée as she studies for school).

## Features

- Supports basic Lisp-style expressions like:
  - `(+ 1 2)`
  - `(- 3 1)`
  - `(+ 1.1 2.2)`
  - `(+ (- 1 2) (+ (+ 2 3) 5))`

- Parses and evaluates S-expressions with support for multiple data types (integers, floats, booleans).

## Example

Here's a quick usage example from `main.rs`:

```rust
use crate::calculator::Calculator;

fn main() {
    let mut calc = Calculator::new();

    let quick_test_strings = vec![
        "(+ 1 2)",
        "(+ 1.1 2.1)",
        "(+ 1.0 2.1)",
        "(+ true false)",
        "(- 2 1)",
    ];

    for s in quick_test_strings {
        let out = calc.process(s);
        println!("{:?}", out);
    }
}
```

Expected output might look like:

```
Ok(Operand::Int(3))
Ok(Operand::Float(3.2))
Ok(Operand::Float(3.1))
Err(...)
Ok(Operand::Int(1))
```

## Build Instructions

Bestie, it's Rust. Use Cargo.

1. Download repo
2. `cargo build`
3. `cargo run`

It's that simple. 

## Why?

This was just a fun side project to experiment with Rust's type system and
parsing while being a good partner for my fiancée while she continues to be 
stuck in school after my graduation.

## How does it work

Basically string substitution. Given a statement it:
1. Finds the innermost parenthesis
2. Gets the appropriate operator
3. Parses the operands
4. Performs the operation
5. Replaces the original statement with the result, parenthesis and all.

There's some validation steps in between those, but yeah basically repeat until there's no innermost statement.

Is it efficient? Probably not tbh.

## TODO

* Add `set` operator for creating variables
  * Will require me to modify the `Operand` enum to support variables. 
    * Maybe...
* Add multiplication, division, integer division, modulus, and boolean operators.

Keep in mind this list might be out of date. 

### Could be Cool

* REPL support
* User defined functions
* A LISP interpreter???? Could be fire.
